#region Enumerators
enum MovementType {STANDARD,HOMING,LOB} 
	# Types of movement behavior for arrow:
	#   Standard: typical arrow-like behavior, straight path of travel.
	#   Homing: projectile curves and follows a chosen target/targets.
	#   Lob: projectile travels above scene and lands onto a target position.

enum DamageType {DIRECT, AOE}
	# Types of movement behavior for arrow:
	#   Direct: applies damage effect on initial collision of target.
	#   AOE: applies damage effect within a specified area.

enum EffectType {HEALTH,SPEED}
	# Types of damage effects:
	#   Health: affects the units health stat.
	#   SpeedDebuff: affects the units speed stat.

enum Lifetime {TIMED, COLLISION, TARGET}
	# Projectile life behvaior types:
	#   Timed: Projectile is destroyed after a certain amount of time.
	#   Collision: Projectile is destoryed after a certain amount of collisions.
	#   Target: Projectile is destroyed after target position is reached.
